Instructions â€“ HW

Provide an implementation of the hire() method in the Organization class.  You can change anything except what is in MyOrganization.


Joseph Congdon notes:

objective:
List out positions that have been filled by new hires.
Account for any positions that have not been filled.

Notes:
All positions have been put into "child compartments" based upon the root
The root is the ceo position

All following positions are off shoots of the ceo

a switch case allows me to go through all general positions and see if they have been filled by the reference myOrg

If I can describe each new hire by the Employee class I can pare the identifier parameter automatically with the person that matches with the job title

In each case I can add another for() if need be to go into the child elements of The President and the CIO. 

The COO remains blank because there is no new person to take the role. No one then has been hired for that position.
